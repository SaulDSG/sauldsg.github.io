        Hello sweet grief
        I know you will be the death of me
        Feel like the morning after ecstasy
        I am drowning in an endless sea
        Hello old friend
        Here’s the misery that knows no end
        So I am doing everything I can
        To make sure I never love again
</p>
<p id="Parrafo2">
        I wish that I did not know
        Where all broken lovers go
        I wish that my heart was made of stone
        Yeah if I was bulletproof
        I’d love you black and blue
        If I was solid like a jewel
</p>
<p id="Parrafo3">
        If I had a diamond heart
        Oh oh
        I’d give you all my love
        If I was unbreakable
        If I had a diamond heart
        Oh oh
        You could shoot me with a gun of gold
        If I was unbreakable
</p>
<p id="Parrafo4">
        I’d walk straight through the bullet
        Bendin’ like a tulip
        Blue-eyed and foolish
        Never mind the bruises
        Into the fire
        Breakin’ through the wires
        Give you all I’ve got
        If I had a diamond heart
        I’d walk straight through the dagger
        Never break the pattern
        Diamonds don’t shatter
        Beautiful and battered
        Into the poison
        Cry you an ocean
        Give you all I’ve got
</p>
<p id="Parrafo5">
        Goodbye, so long
        I don’t know if this is right or wrong
        Am I giving up where I belong?
        'Cause every station is playing our song
        Goodbye my love
        You are everything my dreams made of
        You’ll be Prince and I’m the crying dove
        If I only were unbreakable
</p>
